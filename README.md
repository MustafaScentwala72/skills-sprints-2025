# Mustafa's Portfolio — Skills Sprints 2025
# Learning & Projects — Actively Updating

I graduated in Sept 2024 and took a short break. I’m now rebuilding my skills with a simple,
daily routine and three focused projects. This repo shows my plan and progress.

Target roles: Junior Data Analyst, Junior Data Scientist, Junior AI/Data Consultant  
Status: Reboot in progress — small commits 5–7 days/week  
Last updated: 24 Aug 2025

This repo tracks my upskilling and projects across three target roles:
- **Junior Data Analyst** (SQL, Power BI & DAX, storytelling)
- **Junior Data Scientist** (sklearn pipelines, evaluation, deployment basics)
- **Junior AI/Data Consultant** (KPI design, A/B basics, ROI, roadmaps)

## How to use this repo
- Work in small **daily sprints (60–90 min)**.
- Each folder has a focused **README** with a quick win and a stretch goal.
- Keep commits small with clear messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`).

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows PowerShell:
